I typically like this type of structure. It is very scalable and easy to work with.  Here is CHAT GPT's explanation.

## CHAT GPT Explanation

### Atoms

These are the smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs, or event color pallets, animations, and fonts. They can be applied on any context, globally or within other components/molecules.

```
/atoms
  /Button
    Button.js
    Button.css
  /Input
    Input.js
    Input.css
  /Title
    Title.js
    Title.css
```

### Molecules

They are the composition of one or more components of atoms. Here, we begin to compose complex components and reuse some of those components. An example of a molecule might be a form label (which is a standalone atom) combined with a text input atom to create a complete form input component.

```
/molecules
  /SearchBar
    SearchBar.js
    SearchBar.css
  /SignUpForm
    SignUpForm.js
    SignUpForm.css
```

### Organisms

Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. For example, a website header might be composed of a logo atom, a primary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule all grouped together into a coherent organism.

```
/organisms
  /Header
    Header.js
    Header.css
  /Footer
    Footer.js
    Footer.css
```

### Templates

At the template level, we take our organisms and place them within a layout to see how the page's content will look. It provides context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.

```
/templates
  /ProductPage
    ProductPage.js
    ProductPage.css
  /HomePage
    HomePage.js
    HomePage.css
```

### Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates. This is where we provide our template with real representative content, turning the abstract into the concrete.

```
/pages
  /Home
    Home.js
    Home.css
  /Product
    Product.js
    Product.css
```
