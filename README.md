### Project Description

_Who is it for?_

CourseGPT is meant to provide students on demand access to all of their course
information and lessons. Not only does this support student learning, but it
also alleviates professor workload.

_What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)_

CourseGPT will provide students an interface to ask questions about course
information and content - similar to a personal tutor who has in-depth knowledge
about the courses the student is taking.

_What type of data will it store?_

_What will users be able to do with this data?_

- changing user profile
- copy the responses (copying feature)
- select school/course and use the trained model to ask questions
- report errors / provide feedback on prompt answers
- deleting messages

_What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time
constraints?_
