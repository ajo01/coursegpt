### Project Description

_Who is it for?_

CourseGPT is meant to provide students on demand access to all of their course
information and lessons. Not only does this support student learning, but it
also alleviates professor workload.

_What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)_

CourseGPT will provide students an interface to ask questions about course
information and content - similar to a personal tutor who has in-depth knowledge
about the courses the student is taking.

_What type of data will it store?_

Data objects include: Users, Schools, Courses, Chats, Messages, and Feedback.
Please see [the models folder](server/models). There are additional data objects
necessary for stretch goals.

_What will users be able to do with this data?_

They will be able to select a school and a course that they are interested in
learning about, and begin asking questions to CourseGPT.
They will also be able to view their chat history, delete chats or messages, and
copy and paste the chat messages to outside sources. Additionally, they can
report errors and give feedback on CourseGPT responses so that the developers
can improve the model, accordingly. They can
change their user profile by editing their email and password.

_What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time
constraints?_
